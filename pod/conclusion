SINGLE CONTAINER POD WITHOUT ANY CONTROLLER


1.When a pod yaml is applied, following happens:

  1. Default-Scheduler assigns the pod to a node.
  2. Kubelet mounts volume for the pod.
  3. Kubelet pull the container image.
  4. Kubelet create and run the container.

2.If you restart the container using docker daemon nothing will happen.
  Meaning no change in RV and no change in UID of POD.

3. If stop the container using docker daemon, the RV of POD will change.
   Additionally, following will happen:

   1. Scheduler will NOT schedule the pod again.
   2. Kubelet will NOT remount the volume.
   3. A new container will be created and the old one garbage collected. This is the fundamental approach of Kubernetes.

Verify following:

1.Pods do not, by themselves, self-heal. If a Pod is scheduled to a Node that fails,
  or if the scheduling operation itself fails, the Pod is deleted; likewise, a Pod
  wonâ€™t survive an eviction due to a lack of resources or Node maintenance.

2.Force deletions can be potentially dangerous for some pods and should be performed with caution.Why ?

Ans:Force deletions can be potentially dangereous sometimes as the processes must be in middle of doing
    some work (e.g. R/W operation on disk etc) and the state can be inconsitent.
    Grace period will ensure the process is not taking any further requests and complete whatever is on the
    plate.
